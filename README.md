**🧮 Scientific Calculator**

A sleek, powerful scientific calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It supports basic operations (addition, subtraction, etc.) and advanced functions (trigonometric, logarithmic, exponential), including Shift+Button toggling for inverse functions like sin⁻¹, cos⁻¹, and tan⁻¹.

**✨ Features**

1. Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, ×, ÷)

2. Advanced functions:

    2.1 Trigonometric: sin, cos, tan

    2.2Inverse Trigonometric: sin⁻¹, cos⁻¹, tan⁻¹

    2.3 Logarithmic: log, ln

    2.4 Exponentiation and roots

3. Shift functionality: Toggle between standard and inverse operations

4. Clean and responsive UI

5. Keyboard support for faster input

**🧠 How the Shift Toggle Works**
When the Shift key is pressed, function buttons dynamically switch:

      sin ➔ sin⁻¹
      
      cos ➔ cos⁻¹
      
      tan ➔ tan⁻¹

Releasing Shift returns buttons to their original functions.
